# trimmedMeanUsage

This repository provides a package for calculating the trimmed mean of a slice of floating-point numbers using trimmedMean package. The trimmed mean is a measure of central tendency that is robust to outliers by trimming a specified number of elements from both the lower and upper ends of the sorted data before calculating the mean.

### Results

Here's a summary of the results based on the `trimmedMeanUsage.go` example and the usage of `TrimmedMean` implementation in `trimmedMean` package:

1. **Functionality**:
   - The `TrimmedMean` function calculates the trimmed mean by sorting the slice of numbers and then removing a specified number of elements from both the lower and upper ends.
   - It handles cases where the number of elements to trim is specified for both ends or just one end.
   - The function returns the mean of the remaining elements after trimming and handles errors if the trimming parameters are invalid.

2. **Example Execution**:
   - With the example slice `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` and trimming 1 element from both ends, the trimmed mean is calculated as follows:
     - Sorted Slice: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
     - After trimming 1 from each end: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
     - Mean of the remaining elements: `(2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) / 5 = 4.0`
   - The function will output `Trimmed Mean: 4.0`.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - The function correctly handles invalid trimming values by returning appropriate error messages.
   - It ensures that at least one element remains after trimming; otherwise, it returns an error indicating insufficient data.

### Conclusion

The `TrimmedMean` effectively calculates the trimmed mean of a slice of floating-point numbers, offering a robust measure of central tendency that mitigates the impact of outliers.
